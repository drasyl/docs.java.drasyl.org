# Command Line Tool

It is possible to run drasyl from the command line using the `drasyl` command.
The `drasyl` command makes it possible to start up drasyl nodes, generate identities, and more directly from the command line.

You can download the `drasyl` command from [GitHub](https://github.com/drasyl/drasyl/releases).
The download includes a `bin/drasyl` executable for Linux/macOS users and a `bin/drasyl.bat` for Windows users.

Run `drasyl help` to get an overview of available commands and flags:

## Docker

The [`drasyl/drasyl-java`](https://hub.docker.com/r/drasyl/drasyl-java) image provides the `drasyl` command. So no need to install drasyl on your machine.

For instance:

```bash
$ docker run -i -t drasyl/drasyl-java version
- drasyl-cli.version 0.8.0 (a773985)
- drasyl-core.version 0.8.0 (a773985)
- drasyl-node.version 0.8.0 (a773985)
- drasyl-plugin-groups-client.version 0.8.0 (a773985)
- drasyl-plugin-groups-manager.version 0.8.0 (a773985)
- java.version 11.0.15
- os.name Linux
- os.version 5.10.47-linuxkit
- os.arch amd64
```

To run a node:
```bash
# generate an identity (this can take some time)
$ docker run -i -t drasyl/drasyl-java generate-identity | grep -v "WARNING:" > drasyl.identity

# start a node
$ docker run -i -t -p 22527:22527 \
    -v $PWD/drasyl.identity:/drasyl.identity \
    drasyl/drasyl-java node
```

This command passes the just generated identity to the docker container and then launch the `drasyl node` command.
